## Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global health, economies, and daily life. This project aims to analyze the available data to better understand these impacts. By leveraging the power of Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly, we provide clear visualizations that highlight critical trends.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harukun2110/COVID-19_Global_Impact_Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**  
   Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd COVID-19_Global_Impact_Analysis
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Open Jupyter Notebook**  
   Start Jupyter Notebook to view and run the analysis:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Data Sources

This project primarily uses data from the World Health Organization (WHO). The dataset includes:

- Daily confirmed cases
- Daily deaths
- Vaccination rates
- Testing data

We regularly update the dataset to ensure our analysis reflects the most current information.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes several key technologies:

- **Python**: The main programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visual aesthetics.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and sharing the analysis.

## How to Run the Analysis

To execute the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook files provided in the repository. Each notebook contains code cells that you can run step by step. You can modify the parameters to explore different aspects of the data.

1. Open a notebook (e.g., `COVID_Analysis.ipynb`).
2. Run the cells in order to generate the analysis.
3. Explore the visualizations and insights generated.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to illustrate the data effectively. Here are some examples:

- **Time Series Graphs**: Show trends over time for cases and deaths.
- **Bar Charts**: Compare vaccination rates across different countries.
- **Heat Maps**: Visualize the spread of COVID-19 globally.

These visualizations help convey complex information in an accessible manner.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project. If you have ideas for improvements or new features, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.

Your contributions can help enhance the analysis and provide more insights into the global impact of COVID-19.
